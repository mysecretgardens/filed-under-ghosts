ðŸ•¯ **Intention**: To sever gently, without entanglement or return.  

**Spelltext**:  
I unhook the echo.  
I withdraw the thread.  
I call my name back fully.  
I leave nothing behind but breath.

This sigil was drawn on the inside of a matchbook. I struck every match until the whole pack was spent. Thatâ€™s when I felt the weight lift.
