The only blueprint I had was a rom-com VHS. The tape was warped.  

I’ve spent years trying to restore a corrupted file:  
1. Man meets woman.  
2. Man teaches woman something about herself.  
3. She falls in love with him for knowing it first.

That’s not romance. That’s misrecognition dressed as meaning.
